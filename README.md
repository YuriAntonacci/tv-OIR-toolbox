# tv-OIR-toolbox
This toolbox introduces a novel method that enables time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs by leveraging the Entropy Rate (ER) measure to disentangle interactions in physiological networks. The framework is built on a time-resolved representation of vector autoregressive models, combined with its spectral decomposition at each time step, allowing for the assessment of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes.

The toolbox contains a simulation showing how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific
frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyses. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere

The code is provided free of charge. It is neither exhaustively tested nor particularly well documented. The authors accept no liability for its use. Use, modification and redistribution of the code is allowed in any way users see fit. Authors ask only that authorship is acknowledged and ref. [1] is cited upon utilization of the code in integral or partial form. To get started, we recommend that you run and work through the two demonstration scripts.
